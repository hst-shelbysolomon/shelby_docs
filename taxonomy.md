## Runbook suggestions
A good outline for a software engineering group runbook for onboarding new employees/engineers would include the following sections:
*	Introduction: This section should provide an overview of the software engineering group, including its goals, mission, and culture. It should also introduce the key players in the group, such as the manager, team leads, and senior engineers.
*	Onboarding process: This section should outline the steps involved in onboarding a new employee, from start to finish. It should include information on things like setting up their computer, accessing company resources, and meeting with key stakeholders.
*	Development process: This section should provide an overview of the software development process at the company, including things like agile methodology, code review, and testing. It should also include information on the company's coding standards and style guide.
*	Tools and technologies: This section should list the tools and technologies that are used by the software engineering group. It should also include information on how to access and use these tools.
*	Troubleshooting: This section should provide guidance on how to troubleshoot common problems that may occur during the development process. It should also include information on how to escalate issues to the appropriate team members.
*	Continuous learning: This section should encourage new employees to continue learning and growing in their careers. It should provide information on resources such as online courses, conferences, and meetups.
By following this outline, you can create a runbook that will help new employees get up to speed quickly and efficiently. This will help them contribute to the team sooner and make a positive impact on the company.
In addition to the above, here are some additional tips for creating a good runbook:
*	Use clear and concise language.
*	Use screenshots or diagrams to illustrate complex processes.
*	Make sure the runbook is easy to find and access.
*	Keep the runbook up-to-date as processes change.
*	Encourage employees to contribute to the runbook by submitting feedback and suggestions.
